\begin{abstract}

 This is an introduction to functions suitable for an advanced Grade 4 audience.
 These notes were prepared for the Grand River Chinese School. Each chapter may
 take two to four hours to deliver entirely, depending on the level of detail.

 I have yet to deliver these notes in practice. It may very well be the case
 that this content is mostly inaccessible to the average Grade 4 student.

 These notes are intended to be a rough outline of what is taught, and not a
 rigorous and complete reference. I do not necessarily cover all the material
 written in these notes in any particular year, and I may occasionally cover
 material beyond that written in the notes.

 Although the notes are intended to be presented to a young audience, they are
 written for a teacher and not for a student. Many of the terms used will not be
 familiar to the students, and will need to be explained differently.

\section{Introduction}

Imagine a factory where raw materials are converted into finished products. Each
different kind of raw material is converted into a different kind of product. At
our factory, wood is converted into furniture, glass into windows, silk into
clothing, and cotton also into clothing. We can create a table describing which
raw materials are accepted, and which goods are produced from those raw
materials (Table \ref{fov:factory}).

\begin{table}
 \renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.2}
 \begin{tabular}{|c|c|}
  \hline
  \textbf{In} & \textbf{Out} \\
  \hline
  wood & furniture \\
  glass & windows \\
  silk & clothing \\
  cotton & clothing \\
  \hline
 \end{tabular}

 \caption{Raw inputs accepted by the factory, and the outputs associated with
 them.}
 \label{fov:factory}
\end{table}

The factory that we have described is a simple example of a \gls{function}. For
each input that a function accepts, it has a particular output.
