\begin{abstract}

This is an introduction to functions suitable for an advanced Grade 4 audience.
These notes were prepared for the Grand River Chinese School. Each chapter may
take two to four hours to deliver entirely, depending on the level of detail.

I have yet to deliver these notes in practice. It may very well be the case
that this content is mostly inaccessible to the average Grade 4 student.

These notes are intended to be a rough outline of what is taught, and not a
rigorous and complete reference. I do not necessarily cover all the material
written in these notes in any particular year, and I may occasionally cover
material beyond that written in the notes.

Although the notes are intended to be presented to a young audience, they are
written for a teacher and not for a student. Many of the terms used will not be
familiar to the students, and will need to be explained differently.

\section{Introduction}

Imagine a factory where raw materials are converted into finished products.
Each different kind of raw material is converted into a different kind of
product. At our factory, wood is converted into furniture, glass into windows,
silk into clothing, and cotton also into clothing. We can create a table
describing which raw materials are accepted, and which goods are produced from
those raw materials (Figure~\ref{fov:factory}).

\begin{figure}
 \renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.2}
 \begin{tabular}{|c|c|}
  \hline
  \textbf{In} & \textbf{Out} \\
  \hline
  wood & furniture \\
  glass & windows \\
  silk & clothing \\
  cotton & clothing \\
  \hline
 \end{tabular}

 \caption{Raw inputs accepted by a factory and the outputs associated with
 them}
 \label{fov:factory}
\end{figure}

The factory that we have described is a simple example of a \gls{function}. For
each input that a function accepts, it has a particular output. The set of
possible inputs that a function accepts is called the \gls{domain} of the
function, and the set of possible outputs is called the \gls{range}. For the
function above, the domain consists of wood, glass, silk, and cotton, and the
range consists of furniture, windows, and clothing.

Another way to think about a function, then, is an object that takes any
element in its domain, and associates it with an element of the range. TK.

We see examples of functions all the time in mathematics. A simple example is
the successor function, which takes each whole to the next number. This
function is TK.
