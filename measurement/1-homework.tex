\begin{problem}{Unit Conversion}
  Recall that \begin{itemize}
    \item $\SI{1}{\kilo\metre}=\SI{1000}{\metre}$
    \item $\SI{1}{\metre}=\SI{100}{\centi\metre}$
  \end{itemize}
  Using this information, what is \SI{3}{\kilo\metre} converted to centimetres?
  \hfill \blankE \si{\centi\metre}
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}{Acute, Right, Obtuse}
 Circle the correct category for each angle.

 \begin{itemize}
  \item \SI{123}{\degree} \hfill Acute~~Right~~Obtuse
  \item \SI{88}{\degree} \hfill Acute~~Right~~Obtuse
  \item \SI{90}{\degree} \hfill Acute~~Right~~Obtuse
 \end{itemize}
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}{Angle sum}
 \begin{itemize}
  \item The sum of an acute angle and a right angle is:
        \hfill Acute~~Right~~Obtuse
  \item Half of a right angle is:
        \hfill Acute~~Right~~Obtuse
 \end{itemize}
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}{Triangle angle sum}
 The sum of the angles of a triangle is \SI{180}{\degree}. Two of the angles
 measure \SI{25}{\degree} and \SI{140}{\degree}. What does the third angle
 measure?
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}{Supplementary}
 Two angles are supplementary. One is \SI{20}{\degree} greater than the other.
 Find both angles.
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}{Lines I}
 Five lines are on a plane. No two lines are parallel, and no three (or more)
 lines intersect at a single point. How many points on the plane lie on more
 than one line?
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}{Lines II}
 Find two rays that do not intersect, but if each ray is extended to a line,
 then the resulting lines do intersect. (``Extending'' a ray to a line means
 continuing the ray from its endpoint, but in the opposite direction of the ray.
 The resulting object extends infinitely in both directions, and so is a line.)
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}{Challenge}

\begin{wrapfigure}{r}{0pt}

\end{wrapfigure}

The sum of the interior angles of a triangle is \SI{180}{\degree}.

\begin{enumerate}
 \item What is the sum of interior angles of a rectangle?
 \item Use the picture to show that the sum of interior angles of any pentagon
 is \SI{540}{\degree}.
 \item Draw an octagon (eight-sided shape). What is the sum of its interior
 angles?
 \item When one side is added to a shape (for example, changing a triangle [$3$]
 to a quadrilateral [$4$]), by how much does the angle sum change? Why?
\end{enumerate}
