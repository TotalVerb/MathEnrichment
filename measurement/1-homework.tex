\begin{problem}{Acute, Right, Obtuse}
 Circle the correct category for each angle.

 \begin{itemize}
  \item \SI{123}{\degree} \hfill Acute~~Right~~Obtuse
  \item \SI{88}{\degree} \hfill Acute~~Right~~Obtuse
  \item \SI{90}{\degree} \hfill Acute~~Right~~Obtuse
 \end{itemize}
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}{Angle sum}
 \begin{itemize}
  \item The sum of an acute angle and a right angle is:
        \hfill Acute~~Right~~Obtuse
  \item Half of a right angle is:
        \hfill Acute~~Right~~Obtuse
 \end{itemize}
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}{Complementary angles}
 Complementary angles sum to \SI{90}{\degree} and supplementary angles sum to
 \SI{180}{\degree}. Find the complementary and supplementary angles for each of
 the following.

 \begin{itemize}
  \item \SI{81}{\degree} \hfill Complementary: \blankC \si{\degree}~~
  Supplementary: \blankC \si{\degree}
  \item \SI{18}{\degree} \hfill Complementary: \blankC \si{\degree}~~
  Supplementary: \blankC \si{\degree}
 \end{itemize}

\end{problem}

\begin{problem}{Triangle angle sum}
 The sum of the angles of a triangle is \SI{180}{\degree}. Two of the angles
 measure \SI{25}{\degree} and \SI{140}{\degree}. What does the third angle
 measure?
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}{Supplementary}
 Two angles are supplementary. One is \SI{20}{\degree} greater than the other.
 Find both angles.
\end{problem}

The sum of the interior angles of a triangle is \SI{180}{\degree}.

\begin{enumerate}
 \item What is the sum of interior angles of a rectangle?
 \item Use the picture to show that the sum of interior angles of any pentagon
 is \SI{540}{\degree}.
 \item Draw an octagon (eight-sided shape). What is the sum of its interior
 angles?
 \item When one side is added to a shape (for example, changing a triangle [$3$]
 to a quadrilateral [$4$]), by how much does the angle sum change? Why?
\end{enumerate}
