\begin{problem}{Challenge}
 Jennifer records the colours of cars that pass her house between 8:00 AM and
 9:00 AM for one week. Her results are as below:

 \begin{center}
  \begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|}
  \hline
  Day of Week & Red Cars & Green Cars & Blue Cars & Total \\ \hline
  Monday & 10 & 2 & 2 & \hspace{4cm} \\
  Tuesday & 8 & 4 & 4 & \\
  Wednesday & 9 & 1 & 0 & \\
  Thursday & 11 & 2 & 0 & \\
  Friday & 10 & 1 & 1 & \\
  Saturday & 2 & 0 & 6 & \\
  Sunday & 2 & 0 & 5 & \\ \hline
  Total & & & & \\ \hline
  \end{tabular}
 \end{center}

 \begin{enumerate}
  \item Fill in all missing total values.
  \item Assume that these patterns hold every week. Find the probability that a
  car passing on Tuesday will be red. To do this, divide the red cars that
  passed on Tuesday by the total number of cars passing on Tuesday.
 \end{enumerate}

 This type of problem is called conditional probability.
