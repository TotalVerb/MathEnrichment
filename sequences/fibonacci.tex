\textbf{Recall}: Each term in the Fibonacci sequence is the sum of the previous
two terms. We can write this like: \[
 F_n = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2}
\]

The Fibonacci sequence begins with $F_1 = 1$ and $F_2 = 1$.

\begin{problem}{Continue the sequence}
 Write the next three terms of the Fibonacci sequence.

 \[
  1, 1, 2, 3, 5, \underline{\hspace{2em}}, \underline{\hspace{2em}},
  \underline{\hspace{2em}}
 \]
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}{Going forwards}
 The 11th Fibonacci number is $89$ and the 12th Fibonacci number is $144$.
 What's the 13th Fibonacci number? \hfill Answer: \underline{\hspace{4em}}
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}{Going backwards}
 The 15th Fibonacci number is $610$ and the 16th Fibonacci number is $987$.
 What's the 14th Fibonacci number? \hfill Answer: \underline{\hspace{4em}}
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}{Monkey in the middle}
 The 17th Fibonacci number is $1597$ and the 19th Fibonacci number is $4181$.
 What's the 18th Fibonacci number?
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}{Odd or even?}
 Recall $F_1 = 1$ and $F_2 = 1$. Is $F_{20}$ odd or even? \hfill Circle the
 answer: Odd\hspace{1em}Even
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}{A curious pattern}
 Below is a list of Fibonacci numbers. Fill in the empty row with the square of
 each Fibonacci number (the first few and last few are done for you). The square
 of a number is the number multiplied by itself. For example, the square of $3$
 (denoted $3^2$) is $9$ because $3 \times 3=9$.

 \begin{center}
 \begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|}
 \hline
  Term \# & $F_1$ & $F_2$ & $F_3$ & $F_4$ & $F_5$ & $F_6$ & $F_7$ & $F_8$ &
  $F_9$ & $F_{10}$ & $\ldots$ \\
  \hline Value & $1$ & $1$ & $2$ & $3$ & $5$ & $8$ & $13$ & $21$ & $34$ & $55$ &
  $\ldots$ \\
  \hline Square & $1$ & $1$ & $4$ & & & & & & $1156$ & $3025$ & $\ldots$ \\
  \hline
 \end{tabular}
 \end{center}

 Using this table, compute or look up the following:

 \begin{enumerate}
  \item $\left(F_3\right)^2$ (square of third Fibonacci number) \hfill Answer:
  \underline{\hspace{4em}}
  \item $F_2 \times F_4$ (product of 2nd and 4th Fibonacci numbers) \hfill
  Answer: \underline{\hspace{4em}}
  \item $\left(F_4\right)^2$ \hfill Answer: \underline{\hspace{4em}}
  \item $F_3 \times F_5$ \hfill Answer: \underline{\hspace{4em}}
  \item $\left(F_5\right)^2$ \hfill Answer: \underline{\hspace{4em}}
  \item $F_4 \times F_6$ \hfill Answer: \underline{\hspace{4em}}
  \item $\left(F_6\right)^2$ \hfill Answer: \underline{\hspace{4em}}
  \item $F_5 \times F_7$ \hfill Answer: \underline{\hspace{4em}}
 \end{enumerate}

 Do you notice a pattern? This is known as ``Cassini's Identity''.

 Mathematician Jean-Dominique Cassini (1625--1712) was the first to discover
 this interesting property of these squares. A Fibonacci number's square is
 really close to the product of the Fibonacci numbers to its left and to its
 right. In fact, it is always exactly one off: either bigger by $1$ or smaller
 by $1$! This is true for all Fibonacci numbers. For example, consider
 $\left(F_9\right)^2=1156$, which is just one greater than $F_8 \times F_{10} =
 21 \times 55 = 1155$.
