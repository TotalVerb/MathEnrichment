\section{Quiz Review}

\subsection{Factor Pairs}

Complete the factor pairs.

\begin{itemize}
\item $6 = 1 \times \underline{\hspace{2em}}$
\item $6 = 2 \times \underline{\hspace{2em}}$
\item $6 = 3 \times \underline{\hspace{2em}}$
\item $6 = 6 \times \underline{\hspace{2em}}$
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Factors and Multiples}
Use the word ``factor'' or ``multiple'' to complete each blank.

\begin{itemize}
\item $1$ is a \blankF of every whole number.
\item $0$ is a \blankF of every whole number.
\item $3$ is a \blankF of $9$.
\item All even numbers are \blankF{}s of $2$.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Divisibility}
Circle factors of each number. More than one factor may be circled.

\begin{itemize}
\item $25$ \hfill $1$~~~$2$~~~$5$~~~$10$~~~$100$
\item $172$ \hfill $1$~~~$2$~~~$5$~~~$10$~~~$100$
\item $1793$ \hfill $1$~~~$2$~~~$5$~~~$10$~~~$100$
\item $2000$ \hfill $1$~~~$2$~~~$5$~~~$10$~~~$100$
\end{itemize}

\section{QUIZ}
There is a quiz today. The allocated length for the quiz is $15$ minutes.

\section{Primes II}
We will talk some more about primes today.

\subsection{Prime Factors}
Find one (no need to find all) prime factor for each number.

\begin{itemize}
\item $99959386$ \hfill Factor: \underline{\hspace{2em}}
\item $521976505$ \hfill Factor: \underline{\hspace{2em}}
\end{itemize}
