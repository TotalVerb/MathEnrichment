For reference, here is a list of all prime numbers less than $100$: $2$, $3$,
$5$, $7$, $11$, $13$, $17$, $19$, $23$, $29$, $31$, $37$, $41$, $43$, $47$,
$53$, $59$, $61$, $67$, $71$, $73$, $79$, $83$, $89$ and $97$.

\begin{problem}{Find the Primes}
 Fill in the blanks with prime numbers. (There might be more than one correct
 solution.)

 \begin{itemize}
  \item \(\SAC{5} + \SAC{47} = 52\)
  \item \(\SAC{3} + \SAC{3} + \SAC{67} = 73\)
 \end{itemize}
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}{Prime Factor}
 Find just one prime factor for each number. Do not try to find more.

 \begin{itemize}
  \item $15838$ \hfill Factor: \SAB{2}
  \item $19385$ \hfill Factor: \SAB{5}
  \item $21849$ \hfill Factor: \SAB{3}
 \end{itemize}
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}{Factorize, Part 1}
 Find the unique prime factorization of each number.

 \begin{itemize}
  \item $18$ \hfill $\SAB{2} \times \SAB{3} \times \SAB{3}$
  \item $57$ \hfill $\SAB{3} \times \SAB{19}$
  \item $100$ \hfill $\SAB{2} \times \SAB{2} \times \SAB{5} \times \SAB{5}$
  \item $80$ \hfill $\SAB{2} \times \SAB{2} \times \SAB{2} \times \SAB{2}
  \times \SAB{5}$
 \end{itemize}
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}{Factorize, Part Two}
  A computer has found that \(123456789 = 3803 \times 3607 \times \SAC{3}
  \times \SAC{3}\), where \(3803\) and \(3607\) are prime numbers, and the two
  blanks are prime numbers that I forgot to write down! What goes in the
  blanks?

  Hint: Don't do a full calculation---a good estimate may be good enough.
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}{True or False}
Select True or False for each statement.

\begin{itemize}
  \item $5$ is prime \hfill \TFTrue
  \item $97$ is prime \hfill \TFTrue
  \item $10000000000$ is prime \hfill \TFFalse
  \item Let \(k\) be an integer; if \(k>1\) then $7k$ is composite \hfill
  \TFTrue
  \item All composite numbers have at least \(4\) positive factors
  \hfill \TFFalse
  \item For all positive prime numbers \(p\), \(p^2\) has \(3\) positive factors
  \hfill \TFTrue
  \item Some composite numbers cannot be factored into primes
  \hfill \TFFalse
  \item Let \(p\) be a prime number; then \(p\) cannot be written as the
  product of two primes \hfill \TFTrue
  \item All composite numbers can be written as the product of two primes
  \hfill \TFFalse
  \item For all primes \(p\), \(p^2 + 1\) is prime \hfill \TFFalse
  \item For all positive integers \(n\), \(n^2 + n\) is composite \hfill
  \TFFalse
  \item For all positive integers \(n\), \(n^2 + 3n\) is composite \hfill
  \TFTrue
 \end{itemize}

\end{problem}

\begin{problem}{Challenge}

The notation $5!$ (pronounced ``five factorial'') means the product of all
integers from $1$ to $5$; that is, $1 \times 2 \times 3 \times 4 \times 5$.
Similarly, $3! = 1 \times 2 \times 3$ and $100! = 1 \times 2 \times 3
\times\dots\times 99 \times 100$.

\begin{enumerate}
 \item Find the prime factorization of $4!$. \hfill
 $\SAB{2} \times \SAB{2} \times \SAB{2} \times \SAB{3}$
 \item In the prime factorization of $4!$, how many $2$'s are there?
 \Switch{\Ans{3}}{}
 \item In the prime factorization of $100!$, how many $2$'s are there? (Hint: Do
 not write out the entire prime factorization! Which numbers in the product are
 composite? How many of those composite numbers contain a prime factor of $2$?
 Which of those contain more than one $2$ in their prime factorization?)
 \Switch{\Ans{97}}{}
\end{enumerate}

\end{problem}
