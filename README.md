# Grade 4 Olympic Math curriculum

This curriculum covers in detail Logic, Probability, Geometry, Sequences, and
Number Theory. It was developed for the Grand River Chinese School interest
course in mathematics, at the Grade 4 level.

## Subjects

### Diagnostic

This subject covers more advanced material, perhaps so advanced that it is not
normally taught to fourth graders. This material may be suitable for a more
advanced audience, or for particularly advanced fourth graders.

### Functions

This subject is not yet started. It covers functions: what they are, what they
do, and how to use them.

### Games

This subject currently contains a single fun homework sheet on verbal
arithmetic.

### Geometry

This subject covers angles, polygons, and area. However, many of the documents
are Word documents and have not yet been translated into LaTeX, so this unit is
not yet available.

### Introduction

This subject contains a single lesson introducing the entire curriculum. No
expansion is planned.

### Logic & Probability

This subject covers logic and probability. It is quite short and incomplete.

### Measurement

This subject is planned but not yet started. Stay tuned!

### Number Theory

This subject covers divisibility and primes. It is complete, but significant
expansion is planned.

### Sequences

This subject covers arithmetic, geometric, and Fibonacci sequences. It is
complete but somewhat rough on the edges.

### Skills

This subject will include more skills in the future, but expansion is not
currently a major priority.

### Supplemental

This subject will include more skills in the future, but expansion is not
currently a major priority.
