# Mathematics Enrichment

This curriculum covers in detail Logic, Probability, Geometry, Sequences, and
Number Theory. Most of it was developed for the Grand River Chinese School
interest course in mathematics, at the Grade 4 level, but some of the content is
appropriate for a more advanced audience.

## Highlighted Subjects

### Number Theory (Grade 4)

This subject covers parity, divisibility, primes, factorization, the GCD, and an
introduction to modular arithmetic. It is considered complete, with lesson,
homeworks, answers, and quizzes.

## Subjects in Progress

### Problem Solving (Grade 4)

This subject contains a single lesson introducing the entire curriculum. No
expansion is planned.

### Logic & Probability (Grade 4)

This subject covers logic and probability. It is quite short, but no expansion
is planned.

### Sequences (Grade 4)

This subject covers arithmetic, geometric, and Fibonacci sequences. It is mostly
complete but somewhat rough on the edges.

## Future Subjects

### Operations (High School)

This subject is planned to be a gentle introduction to analysis, covering basic
concepts such as rational exponents at a non-rigorous level but also introducing
some rigorous concepts. It currently contains only one worksheet (with answers)
on numbers and operations. It is aimed at about the Grade 6 level.

### Proof (High School)

This subject is planned to introduce techniques for mathematical proof, and is
aimed at the high school level. It currently contains only one worksheet on
proof by cases.

### Functions (Grade 4)

This subject is not yet started. It covers functions: what they are, what they
do, and how to use them.

### Games (Grade 4)

This subject currently contains a single fun homework sheet on verbal
arithmetic.

### Geometry (Grade 4)

This subject covers angles, polygons, and area. However, many of the documents
are Word documents and have not yet been translated into LaTeX, so this unit is
not yet available.

### Measurement (Grade 4)

This subject is planned but not yet started. Stay tuned!
