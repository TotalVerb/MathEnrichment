    "How would you check for divisibility by $3$ or $9$? You might know the trick. A number is divisible by $3$ if and only if the sum of its digits is divisible by $3$, and a number is divisible by $9$ if and only if the sum of its digits is divisible by $9$.\n",

    "Hold on. What do we mean by digit sum? Let's define the concept mathematically. Let $n$ be a positive whole number with base-$10$ representation $d_id_{i-1}d_{i-2}\\dots d_3d_2d_1$, where all the $d_1$ are digits from $0$ to $9$, and we take the convention that $d_i\\ne 0$. Then define the _sum of digits_ of $n$, denoted by $\\operatorname{s}(n)$, as follows:\n",

    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\operatorname{s}(n) = \\sum_{k=1}^i d_k\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",

    "Why do we define the digits in reverse? That will make expressing $n$ as a sum of powers of $10$ easier. In fact, recall the definition of the base-$10$ system:\n",

    "n = \\sum_{k=1}^i d_k \\cdot 10^{k-1}\n",

Now that we have some syntax, let's verify the properties we alluded to initially. First, let's verify that a number is divisible by $9$ if and only if its sum of digits is divisible by $9$. To compute whether a number is divisible by $9$, we compute what it's remainder would be when divided by $9$, and check if it is zero. In Julia, the remainder operator is `%` (or the `rem` function), and the equality testing operator is `==`."
